== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed a grid? =

While viewing your grids on LuckyGrids you'll see that each grid has embed code provided. You'll need to deduce the ID of the grid by looking at the embed code. The
URL of the grid will be something like "//luckygrids.io/grids/1.js". The number is the ID, so in this case the ID is "1".

Now that we know the id, the shortcode to embed that grid is: [luckygrids id=1]
